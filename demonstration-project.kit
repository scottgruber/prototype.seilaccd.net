      <h1>LACCD Environmental Equity Education Demonstration Project</h1>

      <p class="standfirst">
        SEI’s Demonstration Project connects classrooms to community action — showing how environmental equity can become a living part of college curriculum
        across California.
      </p>

      <p class="lede">
        Through professional development, faculty incentives, and interdisciplinary collaboration, the project empowers instructors to weave environmental
        equity into their teaching. The result: students gain the knowledge, skills, and confidence to advocate for environmental justice in their own
        communities.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Community college students are uniquely positioned to lead change — living, studying, and working in communities most affected by climate and
          environmental inequities.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>True resilience and equity depend on climate-literate communities.</li>
          <li>Students live what we teach and make the most meaningful local connections.</li>
          <li>California Community College students often represent frontline communities disproportionately impacted by climate injustice.</li>
          <li>Climate change continues to burden low-income, working-class, and BIPOC communities most heavily.</li>
        </ul>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Faculty — Why Participate</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Faculty — Common Barriers</h2>
        <ul>
