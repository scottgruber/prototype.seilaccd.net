      <h1>LACCD Environmental Equity Education Demonstration Project</h1>
      <p class="standfirst">With professional development and incentives faculty embed environmental equity into curriculum across disciplines to significantly increase students' capacity to advocate for environmental justice in their communities. </p>
      <p class="lede">Best positioned and most likely to advocate and provide leadership for and in their communities when empowered and informed</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Effective resilience and authentic environmental equity require climate literate communities</li>
      <li>Students live what we teach and can make the most meaningful connections</li>
      <li>CCC students live in the communities most unjustly impacted by climate injustice </li>
      <li>Climate change disproportionately impacts low-income working-class communities of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC).</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>FACULTY WHY</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Understand equity issues</li>
<li>Experience climate anxiety and wish they were able to take more direct action</li>
<li>Have direct contact with students and reach 125-150 students a year (or more)</li>
<li>Need preparation to address changing careers in their disciplines</li> 
</ul>
<h2>FACULTY WHY NOT</h2>
<ul>
<li>Time is too limited to prepare for or address sustainability</li>
<li>Knowledge may seem limited if not in STEM fields</li>
<li>Integration and relevancy into to specific subject areas seems unclear </li>
</ul>
