      <p class="standfirst">We connect classrooms, campuses, and communities to make sustainability a living part of education.</p>


      <p>The Sustainable Environment Institute (SEI) is a faculty-led, district-wide initiative dedicated to advancing environmental sustainability across the
        Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD). </p>

      <p>In partnership with the District Academic Senate, we bring together all nine colleges to ensure students, faculty, and staff have access to the tools
        and resources needed to build environmental awareness and take action.</p>

      <p>SEI coordinates the efforts of the nine LACCD colleges so that students, faculty, administrators, and staff have access to programs, courses,
        activities, and resources that foster environmental awareness and action.</p>

      <p>Since our founding in 2010, SEI has collaborated with community colleges throughout the region, as well as the UC and CSU systems, USC, LAUSD, and
        other K–12 programs. At our core, we are educators who care deeply about the state of the planet and believe in empowering our students to create a more
        sustainable future.</p>
        <blockquote>We help faculty bring sustainability and environmental equity into their teaching, creating opportunities across the district to connect, share, and learn together.</blockquote>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>SEI’s mission is to advance climate action education and engagement. We support faculty in integrating sustainability and environmental equity into
        courses across disciplines, and we provide the district with a wide range of opportunities to connect and learn:</p>
