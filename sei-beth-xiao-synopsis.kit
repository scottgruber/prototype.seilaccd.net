      <h1>“What SEI Does and Why It Matters”</h1>
      <p class="lede">A structured summary of the leadership discussion, with pull-quotes and web-copy ideas derived from the conversation.</p>
      <small>A conversation with Beth and Xiao</small>
      <div class="hr"></div>

      <h3>1. Faculty Professional Development — SEI’s Core Mission</h3>
      <p>Xiao and Beth agree that SEI is fundamentally about faculty professional development in environmental and sustainability education. They describe SEI
        as “the in-house professional development organizers and hosts” — leading research, organizing workshops, and creating demonstration projects that model
        how environmental equity can be embedded in curriculum.</p>
      <blockquote>Pull quote: “We’re the ones taking charge of faculty professional development in this area — no one else is doing it at this scale.”
      </blockquote>

      <h3>2. Demonstration Projects — A Statewide Model</h3>
      <p>Beth emphasizes the Demonstration Project as SEI’s signature initiative — a comprehensive model integrating curriculum innovation, community practice,
        coaching, field trips, and culminating events. It aims to serve as a statewide example for embedding environmental equity into teaching.</p>
      <blockquote class="idea"><strong>Web copy idea:</strong> SEI’s Demonstration Project connects classrooms to community action — showing how environmental
        equity can become a living part of college curriculum statewide.</blockquote>

      <h3>3. Building Partnerships Across the District</h3>
      <p>SEI’s reach extends beyond faculty to include district partnerships with organizations such as The Climate Center, Facilities, ASCCC, and local
        government. They highlight SEI’s bridge role between faculty, administration, and operations — influencing how sustainability is integrated into the
        physical campus environment.</p>
      <blockquote>Pull quote: “We bridge operations and education — connecting facilities, administration, and faculty to make sustainability real on our
        campuses.</blockquote>

      <h3>4. Impact on Facilities and Campus Operations</h3>
      <p>Beth shares that SEI has influenced district-wide facilities policy, ensuring faculty and students can now access construction sites for learning and
        research. This represents a structural change — sustainability as part of how campuses are built and maintained.</p>
      <blockquote class="idea"><strong>Web copy idea:</strong> Because of SEI, new campus construction is now part of the classroom — turning buildings and
        operations into living labs for sustainability.</blockquote>

      <h3>5. Student Opportunities — Internships and Applied Learning</h3>
      <p>Through collaboration with Build LACCD, SEI helped grow internships from 9 to over 100 district-wide. They discuss expanding visibility for these
        programs and connecting more disciplines beyond engineering and architecture.</p>
      <blockquote>Pull quote: “We’ve opened doors for students — from 9 to 100 internships across the district — linking sustainability learning to real jobs.”
      </blockquote>

      <h3>6. Strengthening Curriculum and Enrollment</h3>
      <p>SEI supports colleges in developing new environmental courses (e.g., environmental politics, climate-focused English courses) and boosting enrollment
        through marketing and outreach. They also work with departments to embed climate and sustainability across disciplines.</p>
      <blockquote class="idea"><strong>Web copy idea:</strong> From political science to English, SEI helps faculty embed sustainability in every field —
        growing enrollment and student engagement.</blockquote>

      <h3>7. Shared Governance and Committee Building</h3>
      <p>Beth and Xiao discuss helping campuses form Sustainability Committees — cross-sector, shared-governance bodies including faculty, staff, and
        administrators. These committees strengthen institutional accountability and community engagement.</p>
      <blockquote>Pull quote: “We help campuses form the shared-governance structures that make sustainability everyone’s responsibility.</blockquote>

      <h3>8. Policy and Statewide Leadership</h3>
      <p>The conversation shifts toward policy influence — SEI’s collaborations with lobbyists, local legislators, and statewide initiatives like Vision 2030.
        Beth and Xiao describe SEI’s role as policy advocates advancing sustainability and environmental equity across California community colleges.</p>
      <blockquote class="idea"><strong>Web copy idea:</strong> SEI connects local action to statewide change — influencing district and state policy to
        prioritize environmental equity in education.</blockquote>

      <h3>9. Networking and Representation</h3>
      <p>SEI uplifts faculty by representing them at conferences and statewide events, promoting their work and positioning the district as a leader in
        sustainability education.</p>
      <blockquote>Pull quote: “We amplify our faculty’s voices — putting our district on the map for sustainability leadership.</blockquote>

      <h3>10. Community Engagement and Public Education</h3>
      <p>SEI’s work also reaches the wider public, offering workshops on pressing climate issues — heat, water, fire — and developing resources for communities
        after disasters. They see SEI as a public service center, bridging learning with real-world resilience.</p>
      <blockquote class="idea"><strong>Web copy idea:</strong> SEI’s outreach turns education into community action — from wildfire recovery resources to
        workshops on extreme heat and water.</blockquote>

      <h3>11. Partnerships Beyond the District</h3>
      <p>They mention new collaborations with UCLA, the Center for Diverse Leadership, and local Indigenous communities — expanding SEI’s network and relevance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>We partner with universities, indigenous leaders, and communities — building a network of shared environmental learning.</blockquote>

      <h3>12. Curriculum Support and Faculty Resources</h3>
      <p>SEI is not just training faculty — it’s helping them develop new curriculum, share resources, and access practical tools for integrating environmental
        education into their courses.</p>
      <blockquote class="idea"><strong>Web copy idea:</strong> SEI supports faculty where ideas meet practice — with training, resources, and collaboration that
        make sustainability education achievable.</blockquote>

      <h3>13. Storytelling and Identity</h3>
      <p>The conversation closes with reflection on telling SEI’s story — the need to communicate its scope and contributions clearly so that its value is
        visible and protected within the district.</p>
      <blockquote>It’s important that we exist — and that people understand what we do and why it matters.</blockquote>
